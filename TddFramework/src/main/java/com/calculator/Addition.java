package com.calculator;//Objective:
//        The objective of this activity is to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) by implementing a
//        simple Calculator class in Java. The Calculator class should support basic arithmetic operations
//        such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
//
//        Instructions:
//        A. Begin by writing a failing test for the add method of the Calculator class.
//        B. Implement the add method to pass the test.
//        C. Write tests for the subtract, multiply, and divide methods.
//        D. Implement these methods one by one to pass the tests.
//        E. Refactor your code if necessary.
